ShareShuttle? is a community for people to find others to share rides to and from airports.

We are making it easy for people and their friends to get to the airports directly at a fraction of the cost. This saves both time, money and the environment! A quick trip of a taxi or black car at low shuttle like prices.

Read more about how it works.

Being from New York City, our team decided to create this service to make it easier for our community to share these rides. Direct rides both ways can cost up to the same price as a local airline ticket, and taking the train or subway can take three times as long. That when we realized the opportunity for ShareShuttle? to make it easier for people to find carpool rides.

Come and join us and our community!
